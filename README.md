# Fish Tank Simulation

This is a simple app that simulates a digital fish tank.

The styling is very crude and simple (non-existent lol).

However, it achieves some basic functionality:

- Ability to view fish currently in the tank, alongside their details (name, species, dob and remaining lifetime as a health bar)
- Ability to add new fish in the tank (up to a capacity of 15)
- Fish that are past their lifetime are removed from the tank automatically
